    #   1. Need to crypt both username and password
    #   2. Do not disclose real length of either (otherwise dict-bruteforce is easy)
    #   3. Local per-installation key
    #   4. Resistance to chosen-plaintext (anybody can create URLs with this system)
    # 
    # To satisfy 2, we go with a stream cipher with random padding. We need
    # a salt, otherwise two URLs on the same installation would provide the same
    # stream cipher sequence, and thus being very simple to crack.
    #
    # PyCrypto only provides RC4, which is weak and is better used with a fully random 
    # key, and discarding the initial output.
    #
    # Given a local installation key L1-L12, we end up with:
    # 1) Generate a 20-byte salt S.
    # 2) Generate K1 = HMAC-SHA1(L1, S)
    # 3) Generate K[N] = HMAC-SHA1(L[N], K[N-1])
    #    This basically diffuses S into K, in a way that shouldn't be easy to
    #    tweak or control.
    # 4) Initialize RC4 with K1-K12.
    # 5) Dscard the first 256 bytes of RC4 output.
    # 6) Encrypt the plaintext prepended with a random-length padding (with \0 as separator).
